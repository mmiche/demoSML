# B1 R code underlying appendix C

Appendix C is meant to serve as a bridge that connects the minimalist demonstration of supervised machine learning (sML) in the manuscript with the exemplary real-world sML analyses in this supplementary demoSML R package.

In this supplementary appendix C material, we copied the same sML procedure from the manuscript (where 5 observations were used), and added two important aspects:

1. Increase the sample size.

2. Standardize (z-transform) the predictor.

We did not standardize the predictor values in the manuscript, because it would have complicated the straight forward demonstration of the sML *principles* unnecessarily. That is, nothing would have been gained, at the cost of an additional cognitive challenge. This challenge is better placed in this vignette (see below).

Standardization transforms a numerical variable, e.g., predictor values, so that after transformation its mean is zero and its standard deviation is one. This is done very often in sML (e.g., Singh and Singh, 2020).

Standardization: The mean of the original values is subtracted from each original value in the variable, and divided by the standard deviation of the original values.

### Small standardization example
Original values of a variable be: 5, 6, 7, 8. Mean = 6.5. Standard deviation (sd) = 1.29.
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
values <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)
# Compute standardized values manually
(values - mean(values))/sd(values)
# Output
[1] -1.1618950 -0.3872983  0.3872983  1.1618950

# Compute standardized values with R function scale()
scale(values) # mean = 6.5, sd = 1.290994
# Output
           [,1]
[1,] -1.1618950
[2,] -0.3872983
[3,]  0.3872983
[4,]  1.1618950
attr(,"scaled:center")
[1] 6.5
attr(,"scaled:scale")
[1] 1.290994

# Confirm that the transformed values have mean = 0 and sd = 1
mean(scale(values)) # mean = 0
# Output
[1] 0

sd(scale(values)) # sd = 1
# Output
[1] 1
```

## Standardization (z-transformation) of predictor(s) in sML
Maybe the most frequently stated reason to standardize predictors in sML is to prevent that any predictor is preferred by the algorithm over other predictors, only due to its scale properties, e.g., a wider range of values than that of other predictors. A lower prediction performance can also result from not standardizing predictors (Nkikabahizi et al., 2022).

In this supplementary appendix C material, we want to demonstrate how the sML research logic manifests itself when standardizing the predictor values. Since sML aims to accurately predict *new* outcome values on the individual level, 
and because *tuning* often is a routine part of the whole sML procedure, standardizing predictor values manifests itself accordingly:

* Standardize predictor(s) in the *training subset*.
* In both, the *test subset* and the *validation subset*, standardize the predictor values, respectively, by using the mean and standard deviation of the *training subset*.

As we mentioned in the manuscript, sML research must attempt to simulate the real-world implementation of a prediction algorithm as closely as possible. This is expressed in the use of the mean and standard deviation only from the *training subset*, since only the training data will be known, prior to implementing an algorithm in a real-world setting.

### Small sML standardization example
For this small example we just use a training and a test subset (no validation subset).
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
trainingValues <- c(5, 6, 7, 8)
# Save mean of trainingValues (6.5)
trainingMean <- mean(trainingValues)
# Save sd of trainingValues (1.290994)
trainingSD <- sd(trainingValues)
testValues <- c(6, 7, 8)
# Scale the test values according to mean and sd of the training values
(testValuesScaled <- scale(testValues, center = trainingMean, scale = trainingSD))
# Output
           [,1]
[1,] -0.3872983
[2,]  0.3872983
[3,]  1.1618950
attr(,"scaled:center")
[1] 6.5
attr(,"scaled:scale")
[1] 1.290994
# Unless training and test values are exactly alike, test mean is not 0, test sd is not 1, after standardization.
mean(testValuesScaled)
# Output
[1] 0.3872983
sd(testValuesScaled)
# Output
[1] 0.7745967
```

## Appendix C function **myDemoSML1**.
Note that the value 1 (in myDemoSML1) only shows that the function is not exactly the same as the function myDemoSML in the vignette 'B.0 R code that underlay the manuscript and appendices A and B'. However, the sML procedure is exactly the same. That is, in the manuscript and appendix B (*N* = 5 observations) 60% of the total sample was used for training (3 observations), while 20% (1 observation) was held out for the test and the validation performance, respectively.
In this supplementary appendix C material, only two things changed:

* Instead of 5 observations, we used 18 different sample sizes, starting at 15, ending at 100, each time adding 5 observations to the previous sample size. Therefore, each test and validation subset consisted of more than 1 single observation.
* Instead of the squared residual error of 1 test and 1 validation individual, we now use the mean squared residual error (mse), because the test and validation subsets consist of more than 1 single observation. That is, 'summarizing' a single individual's prediction error is not possible, whereas for a group of individuals the prediction error must be summarized to evaluate a model's prediction performance.

The data simulation function **makeData** is the only function that is embedded in the **demoSML** R package. This means that it can be used right away and that it is documented. Just enter ?makeData in the R console, after the demoSML package has been installed and loaded.

Name of the function: **myDemoSML1**. The function contains 3 arguments:

* data: data set to be given to the function. The data set must contain a data set with a continuous predictor (column name must be x) and a continuous outcome (column name must be y). Furthermore, the sample size must be greater than and a multiple of 5.
* tune: the value that shall be added to the linear model's regression weight after model fitting; default is NULL, which means 'no tuning'.
* seed: a single integer value, e.g., 1, which will be used for splitting the total sample size into five subsets. A seed guarantees reproducibility of the results of the simulated data sets.

Note. In the code chunk below the words training (sML step 4), testing (sML step 5), and validating (sML step 6) are emphasized (capital letters with a whitespace between them). Furthermore, see the detailed description of the results of the demoSML function in the vignette 'B0: R code underlying the manuscript and appendices A and B' (table of contents: Table 3 (left part, without tuning)). The output structure of both, the demoSML and the demoSML1 function, is identical.

The boxplots show what is expected from dummy tuning: No improved prediction performance, compared to no dummy tuning. With increasing sample size, boxplots are very similar, often almost identical. The reason for the almost identical boxplots are easy to explain when looking at the selected tuning values (in the range between 0.001 and 1.0).

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
(tuneVecDf <- data.frame(smps, t=tuneVec))
# Output in console
   smps          t
1    15 0.25327273
2    20 0.46518182
3    25 0.98990909
4    30 0.00100000
5    35 0.27345455
6    40 0.48536364
7    45 0.48536364
8    50 0.01109091
9    55 0.00100000
10   60 0.00100000
11   65 0.00100000
12   70 0.00100000
13   75 0.30372727
14   80 0.00100000
15   85 0.00100000
16   90 0.90918182
17   95 0.00100000
18  100 0.49545455
```

The value 0.001 had been selected as best tuning value in 8 of the 18 different sample sizes, e.g., for a sample size (smps) of 30. This says that almost the same simple linear regression has been computed twice, since 0.001 is approximately 0 (adding almost 0 to the estimated regression weight). Therefore, the boxplots must be almost identical.

For selected tuning values in the mid-range, e.g., 0.485 for sample size 40 or 45, the tuned test performance appears a tiny bit better, compared to no tuning. However, the validation boxplots overlap almost completely between "tuning" and not tuning. The high-range tuning value of 0.909 for sample size 90, also is in line with the expected dummy behavior.
